### **During the Interview**

#### **Communication Framework**
```
1. Problem Understanding (5-10 min):
   - Restate the problem in your own words
   - Ask clarifying questions about edge cases
   - Confirm input/output formats and constraints
   - Work through 1-2 examples manually

2. Solution Planning (5-10 min):
   - Explain your approach before coding
   - Discuss time/space complexity
   - Consider alternative approaches
   - Get interviewer's feedback on direction

3. Implementation (20-25 min):
   - Code incrementally with explanation
   - Think out loud about your decisions
   - Handle edge cases as you encounter them
   - Ask for hints if stuck (better than silence)

4. Testing & Optimization (5-10 min):
   - Walk through your solution with examples
   - Consider edge cases and error conditions
   - Discuss potential optimizations
   - Clean up code if time permits
```

#### **Red Flags to Avoid**
```
‚ùå Jumping straight to coding without discussion
‚ùå Going silent for extended periods
‚ùå Ignoring interviewer's hints or feedback
‚ùå Not explaining your thought process
‚ùå Dismissing edge cases or error handling
‚ùå Being inflexible when direction needs to change
‚ùå Not asking any questions about the role/company
```

### **Post-Interview Best Practices**

#### **Follow-up Strategy**
```
Same Day:
- Send thank you email to interviewer(s)
- Mention specific discussion points
- Provide any additional thoughts/solutions

Within 48 hours:
- Connect on LinkedIn if appropriate
- Follow up with recruiter on timeline
- Document experience for future reference

If Rejected:
