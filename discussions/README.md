## 📝 How to Participate

### Asking Questions
1. **Search first** - Check if your question has been answered
2. **Be specific** - Provide context, code, and error messages
3. **Show effort** - Explain what you've tried
4. **Use formatting** - Format code properly for readability

### Example Good Question:
```
Title: "Understanding time complexity of nested loops"

I'm working on the Two Sum problem and trying to understand why 
the brute force solution is O(n²). Here's my code:

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                return new int[]{i, j};
            }
        }
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
```

I understand there are two loops, but why is it n² and not 2n?
Can someone explain the mathematical reasoning?
```

### Providing Answers
1. **Be helpful** - Focus on teaching, not just solving
2. **Explain thoroughly** - Break down complex concepts
3. **Provide examples** - Use concrete examples when possible
4. **Suggest resources** - Link to helpful materials

### Example Good Answer:
```
Great question! The time complexity is O(n²) because of how the 
nested loops interact:

The outer loop runs n times (where n is array length).
For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs:
- When i=0: (n-1) times
- When i=1: (n-2) times  
- When i=2: (n-3) times
- ...
- When i=n-2: 1 time

Total iterations = (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = n(n-1)/2

In Big O notation, we drop constants and lower-order terms:
n(n-1)/2 = (n² - n)/2 ≈ n²/2 ≈ O(n²)

This is why it's quadratic, not linear. Each element is compared 
with every other element exactly once.

For a more efficient O(n) solution, consider using a HashMap...
